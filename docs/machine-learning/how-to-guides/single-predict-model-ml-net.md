#Customer intent: As a developer, I want to use the ML.NET PredictionEngine to run an example at a time through the prediction pipeline machine learning model so that I can use my machine learning model as part of my application to make and act on one prediction at a time.

# Use the PredictionEngine to make one prediction at a time - ML.NET 

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to ML.NET, which is currently in Preview, and material may be subject to change. For more information, visit [the ML.NET introduction](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet).

This how-to and related sample are currently using **ML.NET version 0.10**. For more information, see the release notes at the [dotnet/machinelearning GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/tree/master/docs/release-notes).

Since any ML.NET model is a transformer, you use `model.Transform` to apply the model to the `DataView` to make predictions. 

A more typical case, though, is when there is no 'dataset' that you want to predict on, but instead you receive one example at a time. For instance, you run the model as part of your ASP.NET website, and need to make a prediction for an incoming HTTP request.

The `PredictionEngine` runs one example at a time through the prediction pipeline.

Here is the full example using a prebuilt Iris prediction dataset model:

```csharp
// Create a new context for ML.NET operations. It can be used for exception tracking and logging, 
// as a catalog of available operations and as the source of randomness.
var mlContext = new MLContext();

// Step one: read the data as an IDataView.
// First, we define the reader: specify the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextLoader(
    columns: new TextLoader.Column[]
    {
        // The four features of the Iris dataset will be grouped together as one Features column.
        new TextLoader.Column("SepalLength",DataKind.R4,0),
        new TextLoader.Column("SepalWidth",DataKind.R4,1),
        new TextLoader.Column("PetalLength",DataKind.R4,2),
        new TextLoader.Column("PetalWidth",DataKind.R4,3),
        // Label: kind of iris.
        new TextLoader.Column("Label",DataKind.TX,4)
    },
    separatorChar: ',',
    hasHeader: true
);

// Retrieve the training data.
var trainData = reader.Read(irisDataPath);

// Build the training pipeline.
var pipeline =
    // Concatenate all the features together into one column 'Features'.
    mlContext.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "SepalLength", "SepalWidth", "PetalLength", "PetalWidth")
    // Note that the label is text, so it needs to be converted to key.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Categorical.MapValueToKey("Label"), TransformerScope.TrainTest)
    // Use the multi-class SDCA model to predict the label using features.
    .Append(mlContext.MulticlassClassification.Trainers.StochasticDualCoordinateAscent())
    // Apply the inverse conversion from 'PredictedLabel' column back to string value.
    .Append(mlContext.Transforms.Conversion.MapKeyToValue(("Data", "PredictedLabel")));

// Train the model.
var model = pipeline.Fit(trainData);
```

To use [schema comprehension](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/docs/code/SchemaComprehension.md) for prediction, define a pair of classes like the following:

```csharp
private class IrisInput
{
    // Unfortunately, we still need the dummy 'Label' column to be present.
    [ColumnName("Label")]
    public string IgnoredLabel { get; set; }
    public float SepalLength { get; set; }
    public float SepalWidth { get; set; }
    public float PetalLength { get; set; }
    public float PetalWidth { get; set; }
}

private class IrisPrediction
{
    [ColumnName("Data")]
    public string PredictedClass { get; set; }
}
```

The prediction code now looks as follows:

```csharp
// Create a new context for ML.NET operations. It can be used for exception tracking and logging, 
// as a catalog of available operations and as the source of randomness.
var mlContext = new MLContext();

// Use the model for one-time prediction.
// Make the prediction function object. Note that, on average, this call takes around 200x longer
// than one prediction, so you might want to cache and reuse the prediction engine, instead of
// creating one per prediction.
var predictionEngine = model.CreatePredictionEngine<IrisInput, IrisPrediction>(mlContext);

// Obtain the prediction. Remember that 'Predict' is not reentrant. If you want to use multiple threads
// for simultaneous prediction, make sure each thread is using its own PredictionEngine.
var prediction = predictionEngine.Predict(new IrisInput
{
    SepalLength = 4.1f,
    SepalWidth = 0.1f,
    PetalLength = 3.2f,
    PetalWidth = 1.4f
});
```
