# Load data from a text file for machine learning processing - ML.NET

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to ML.NET, which is currently in Preview, and material may be subject to change. For more information, visit [the ML.NET introduction](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet).

This how-to and related sample are currently using **ML.NET version 0.10**. For more information, see the release notes at the [dotnet/machinelearning GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/tree/master/docs/release-notes).

`TextLoader` is used to load data from text files. You need to specify the data columns, their types, and their location in the text file.

Note that it's perfectly acceptable to read some columns of a file, or read the same column multiple times.

[Example file](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/master/test/data/adult.tiny.with-schema.txt):

```console
Label	Workclass	education	marital-status
0	Private	11th	Never-married
0	Private	HS-grad	Married-civ-spouse
1	Local-gov	Assoc-acdm	Married-civ-spouse
1	Private	Some-college	Married-civ-spouse
```

To load the data from a text file:

```csharp
// Create a new context for ML.NET operations. It can be used for exception tracking and logging, 
// as a catalog of available operations and as the source of randomness.
var mlContext = new MLContext();

// Create the reader: define the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextLoader(
    columns: new TextLoader.Column[]
    {
        // A boolean column depicting the 'target label'.
        new TextLoader.Column("IsOver50k",DataKind.BL,0),
        // Three text columns.
        new TextLoader.Column("WorkClass",DataKind.TX,1),
        new TextLoader.Column("Education",DataKind.TX,2),
        new TextLoader.Column("MaritalStatus",DataKind.TX,3)
    },
    hasHeader: true
);

// Now read the file (remember though, readers are lazy, so the actual reading will happen when the data is accessed).
var data = reader.Read(dataPath);
```
