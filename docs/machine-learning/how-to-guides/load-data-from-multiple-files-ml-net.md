# Load data from multiple files for machine learning processing - ML.NET

> [!NOTE]
> This topic refers to ML.NET, which is currently in Preview, and material may be subject to change. For more information, visit [the ML.NET introduction](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet).

This how-to and related sample are currently using **ML.NET version 0.10**. For more information, see the release notes at the [dotnet/machinelearning GitHub repo](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/tree/master/docs/release-notes).

Use the `TextLoader`, and specify an array of files to the `Read` method. The files must have the same schema (same number and type of columns):

* [Example file1](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/e3a34ae6ae1b25ac96faa0317308703ce943ff95/test/data/adult.train)
* [Example file2](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/e3a34ae6ae1b25ac96faa0317308703ce943ff95/test/data/adult.test)

```csharp
// Create a new context for ML.NET operations. It can be used for exception tracking and logging, 
// as a catalog of available operations and as the source of randomness.
var mlContext = new MLContext();

// Create the reader: define the data columns and where to find them in the text file.
var reader = mlContext.Data.CreateTextLoader(
    columns: new TextLoader.Column[]
    {
        // A boolean column depicting the 'target label'.
        new TextLoader.Column("IsOver50k",DataKind.BL,0),
        // Three text columns.
        new TextLoader.Column("WorkClass",DataKind.TX,1),
        new TextLoader.Column("Education",DataKind.TX,2),
        new TextLoader.Column("MaritalStatus",DataKind.TX,3)
    },
    hasHeader: true
);

// Now read the files (remember though, readers are lazy, so the actual reading will happen when the data is accessed).
var data = reader.Read(exampleFile1, exampleFile2);
```
