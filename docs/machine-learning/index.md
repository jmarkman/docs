# ML.NET Content Guide

This guide explains basic concepts and provides tutorials and an API reference for working with ML.NET.

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation refers to ML.NET, which is currently in Preview. Material may be subject to change. For more information, see the [ML.NET introduction](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/apps/machine-learning-and-ai/ml-dotnet).

## Get started

To install and start building in ML.NET, follow the [Get started tutorial](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet-get-started-tutorial).

To learn about ML.NET, see [What is ML.NET?](what-is-mldotnet.md)

To understand basics, see [Basic concepts for model training in ML.NET](basic-concepts-model-training-in-mldotnet.md).

## Tutorials

[Analyze sentiment using a binary classification model](tutorials/sentiment-analysis.md) shows you how to build an app that determines whether sentiment is positive or negative.

[Classify GitHub issues using a multiclass classification model](tutorials/github-issue-classification.md) shows you how to build an app that determines the Area label for a GitHub issue.

[Predict prices using a regression model](tutorials/taxi-fare.md) shows you how to build a predictive app that uses many factors from historical data to determine the answer.

[Classify iris flowers by features](tutorials/iris-clustering.md) shows you how to use a clustering model to analyze the iris data set. 

## How to guide

[Build a game match-up list app with Infer.NET and probabilistic programming](how-to-guides/matchup-app-infer-net.md) shows you how to build a simplified version of a match-up app like you'd see in an Xbox game.

## Resources

[Machine learning glossary](resources/glossary.md) defines key terminology.

[Machine learning tasks](resources/tasks.md) describes tasks, such as classification and anomaly detection. 

[Data transforms](resources/transforms.md) describes data preparation capabilities in ML.NET.


## API reference

[ML.NET API Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/?view=ml-dotnet) describes the breadth of APIs available.
