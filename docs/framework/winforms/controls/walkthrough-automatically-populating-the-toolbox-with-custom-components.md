# Walkthrough: Automatically Populating the Toolbox with Custom Components
If your components are defined by a project in the currently open solution, they will automatically appear in the **Toolbox**, with no action required by you. You can also manually populate the **Toolbox** with your custom components by using the [Choose Toolbox Items Dialog Box (Visual Studio)](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/dyca0t6t(v=vs.100)), but the **Toolbox** takes account of items in your solution's build outputs with all the following characteristics:  
  
-   Implements <xref:System.ComponentModel.IComponent>;  
  
-   Does not have <xref:System.ComponentModel.ToolboxItemAttribute> set to `false`;  
  
-   Does not have <xref:System.ComponentModel.DesignTimeVisibleAttribute> set to `false`.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The **Toolbox** does not follow reference chains, so it will not display items that are not built by a project in your solution.  
  
 This walkthrough demonstrates how a custom component automatically appears in the **Toolbox** once the component is built. Tasks illustrated in this walkthrough include:  
  
-   Creating a Windows Forms project.  
  
-   Creating a custom component.  
  
-   Creating an instance of a custom component.  
  
-   Unloading and reloading a custom component.  
  
 When you are finished, you will see that the **Toolbox** is populated with a component that you have created.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The dialog boxes and menu commands you see might differ from those described in Help depending on your active settings or edition. To change your settings, choose **Import and Export Settings** on the **Tools** menu. For more information, see [Personalize the Visual Studio IDE](/visualstudio/ide/personalizing-the-visual-studio-ide).  
  
## Creating the Project  
 The first step is to create the project and to set up the form.  
  
#### To create the project  
  
1.  Create a Windows-based application project called `ToolboxExample` (**File** > **New** > **Project** > **Visual C#** or **Visual Basic** > **Classic Desktop** > **Windows Forms Application**).  
  
2.  Add a new component to the project. Call it `DemoComponent`.  
  
     For more information, see [How to: Add New Project Items](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/w0572c5b(v=vs.100)).  
  
3.  Build the project.  
  
4.  From the **Tools** menu, click the **Options** item. Click **General** under the **Windows Forms Designer** item and ensure that the **AutoToolboxPopulate** option is set to **True**.  
  
## Creating an Instance of a Custom Component  
 The next step is to create an instance of the custom component on the form. Because the **Toolbox** automatically accounts for the new component, this is as easy as creating any other component or control.  
  
#### To create an instance of a custom component  
  
1.  Open the project's form in the **Forms Designer**.  
  
2.  In the **Toolbox**, click the new tab called **ToolboxExample Components**.  
  
     Once you click the tab, you will see **DemoComponent**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  For performance reasons, components in the auto-populated area of the **Toolbox** do not display custom bitmaps, and the <xref:System.Drawing.ToolboxBitmapAttribute> is not supported. To display an icon for a custom component in the **Toolbox**, use the **Choose Toolbox Items** dialog box to load your component.  
  
3.  Drag your component onto your form.  
  
     An instance of the component is created and added to the **Component Tray**.  
  
## Unloading and Reloading a Custom Component  
 The **Toolbox** takes account of the components in each loaded project, and when a project is unloaded, it removes references to the project's components.  
  
#### To experiment with the effect on the Toolbox of unloading and reloading components  
  
1.  Unload the project from the solution.  
  
     For more information about unloading projects, see [How to: Unload and Reload Projects](https://docs.microsoft.com/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/tt479x1t(v=vs.100)). If you are prompted to save, choose **Yes**.  
  
2.  Add a new **Windows Application** project to the solution. Open the form in the **Designer**.  
  
     The **ToolboxExample Components** tab from the previous project is now gone.  
  
3.  Reload the `ToolboxExample` project.  
  
     The **ToolboxExample Components** tab now reappears.  
  
## Next Steps  
 This walkthrough demonstrates that the **Toolbox** takes account of a project's components, but the **Toolbox** is also takes account of controls. Experiment with your own custom controls by adding and removing control projects from your solution.
