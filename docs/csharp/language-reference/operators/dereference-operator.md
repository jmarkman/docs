# -> Operator (C# Reference)

The pointer member access operator `->` combines pointer indirection and member access.

If `x` is a pointer of the type `T*` and `y` is an accessible member of `T`, an expression of the form

```csharp
x->y
```

is equivalent to

```csharp
(*x).y
```

The `->` operator requires [unsafe](../keywords/unsafe.md) context.

For more information, see [How to: access a member with a pointer](../../programming-guide/unsafe-code-pointers/how-to-access-a-member-with-a-pointer.md).

## Operator overloadability

The `->` operator cannot be overloaded.

## C# language specification

For more information, see the [Pointer member access](~/_csharplang/spec/unsafe-code.md#pointer-member-access) section of the [C# language specification](../language-specification/index.md).
